# Brad Myers advisee tree

*(Last update, 2/21/2026)*  
**This page has the short address: [http://tinyurl.com/myersadviseetree](http://tinyurl.com/myersadviseetree)**

**See also a [cool animation](http://fredhohman.com/brad-myers-advisee-tree/) by [*Fred Hohman*](http://fredhohman.com/) *(gen. 5), [Robert Pienta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-pienta/) (gen. 5), and [Polo Chau](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dchau/) (gen. 4\)* of the list as of 2023:  [http://fredhohman.com/brad-myers-advisee-tree/](http://fredhohman.com/brad-myers-advisee-tree/)**

For my [award talk](http://www.sigchi.org/about/awards/2017-sigchi-awards#brad-a-myers) at the **CHI’2017** conference, I highlighted all my successful advisees, and all of their advisees, all the way down. About 9 of my 21 direct advisees are faculty, and it goes down at least **7 generations** now (counting me) along the longest path (my advisee who is faculty has an advisee who is faculty, who has an advisee …., etc.).

* If you are interested in my talk, there is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVoovFR5nUY&index=4&list=PLqhXYFYmZ-VdN5HgctBjq-w8npaCY17E1) (1:18:12), [slides](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/CHI-award-talk/MyersCHI-AwardTalk2017slides.pdf), [abstract](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/CHI-award-talk/ea10-myers-CHI-AwardTalk2017paper.pdf) and [Steven Feiner's introduction](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/CHI-award-talk/skf-2017BradMyers-LifetimeResearchAwardBlurb.pdf).  
* The list below is limited to only **PhD students** who are direct **advisees** or **co-advisees**, *not* postdocs and *not* when you were just on the thesis committee (and *not* masters or undergrad students).  Also, *not* interns for people who are in industry.  
* If anyone is missing from this tree, please let me know\! For example, please add a suggestion for new people who are advisees.  
* If you know the advisees or other information about other people listed, please go ahead and provide a suggestion, since probably everyone won’t answer for themselves.  
* If two people on the list co-advised a single person, that person is listed in both lists, but there is a cross-reference in both locations and the sub-tree of that person’s own advisees are listed only once, with the top-most entry.  
* If someone formerly was at one or more universities, and has subsequently moved to industry, be sure to mention the faculty stint, and include any PhD students during that time.  
* **See also a [cool animation](http://fredhohman.com/brad-myers-advisee-tree/) by [*Fred Hohman*](http://fredhohman.com/) *(gen. 5), [Robert Pienta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-pienta/) (gen. 5), and [Polo Chau](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dchau/) (gen. 4).*:  [http://fredhohman.com/brad-myers-advisee-tree/](http://fredhohman.com/brad-myers-advisee-tree/).** Note that the people in the animation are in a *different order* than below, and it represents the status as of 5/3/2020 (updated from the version of 5/5/2017 shown at CHI’2017).   
  * For the **2017** version: See also the [cool ribbon](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/CHI-award-talk/myers-advisee-tree-Ribbon.png) (purple)  they also designed for people at the conference (and [the ribbon in context on my badge](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/chibadges/chi2017ribbons.JPG)), and [a static picture](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/CHI-award-talk/myers-advisee-tree-handout.pdf) of the end of the animation (all showing the CHI’2017 version).  
  * Fred created in **2020**  [a new ribbon](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/CHI-award-talk/brad-ribbon-2020.pdf), for [CHI’2020](https://chi2020.acm.org/), but when the conference was canceled, we never had it made.  
  * For the **2022** version: Here is the [updated ribbon](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/CHI-award-talk/brad-ribbon-2022.png) (black) and it [on my badge](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/chibadges/chi2022ribbons.JPG) for CHI’2022, and a [picture of the entire tree](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/CHI-award-talk/2022%20advisee%20tree.png).  
  * For the **2023** version: here is the [updated ribbon](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/CHI-award-talk/brad-ribbon-2023.png) (white), the [ribbon on my badge](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Ebam/chibadges/chi2023ribbons.JPG), and a [pdf of the whole tree](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/CHI-award-talk/2023-tree.pdf).  
  * Updated the list in April, **2025**, but didn’t make a new ribbon  
* See [a picture of the about 34 of these advisees](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/CHI-award-talk/IMG_3473%20Brad's%20advisee%20tree%20people%20\(34\).JPG) who attended my talk at the CHI’2017 conference.  
* As of 2/12/2026, there were **469** advisees on the tree (7 co-advised duplicates counted only once). This is up from **379** on 4/24/2025, **332** advisees on 3/4/2023, **293** advisees on 3/21/2022, and **238** on 5/5/2020, and **179** on 5/5/2017 for CHI’2017 \-- 153% more in 9 years\! Of these, about **92** are (or were) professors (not counting me and my advisors). The breakdown by generation is as follows, where I am the first generation, my 21 direct advisees are the 2nd generation, etc.  
  * 1st:	*me*  
    2nd:	21  
    3rd	119  
    4th:	185  
    5th:	129  
    6th:	21  
    7th:	1

Thanks very much for your interest\!
